In this blog, I am documenting my learning journey in quantum computing and quantum mechanics.


I am mainly writing for myself, trying to explain/clarify concepts to myself while writing and crystallising them for future use too. 

Through this blog, I am implementing the concept of “The Best Way to Learn s to Teach”.

If you stumbled across this blog and you find it useful, then that's destiny :)
